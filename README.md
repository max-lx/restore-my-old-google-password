restore-my-old-google-password
==============================

Google does not allow you to use previous password for your account for security reason, but in some cases you really need to restore the old one. 
What can we do? - Just reset password 100 times! 
Seems like Google stores information about your last 100 passwords. 
This tool will help you to reset password automatically many many times.
